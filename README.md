MapSketcher
===========

MapSketcher is an application to annotate maps in collaborative groups.

It's mainly designed for education but feel free to use it to whatever it suits you.

Node.js Version
---------------

I'm currently rewriting it to work with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Setup
-----

Simply install [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/), [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and node.js
and run:

    npm bundle vendor
    node server.js
