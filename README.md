MapSketcher
===========

MapSketcher is an application to annotate maps in collaborative groups.

It's mainly designed for education but feel free to use it to whatever it suits you.
To check a demo of the application visit [this page](http://mapsketcher.sagmor.com).

Setup
-----

MapSketcher was designed to be easily deployed at Heroku so you can get your own instance of MapSketcher running simply by executing this commands:

    git clone git://github.com/sagmor/mapsketcher.git
    cd mapsketcher
    heroku create

Also if you want to take advantage of other advanced features of MapSketcher, I recomend yo to check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/sagmor/mapsketcher/wiki/Configuration) page in the wiki.
